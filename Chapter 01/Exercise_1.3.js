let array = ["cats", "dogs", "AscendantAlf", "Bison"];
//doesn't really need to be more descriptive now. lol

console.log(array);


let table = [1, 2 , 3 ,4]

console.table(table);

/*let's see if .table() overwrites the way
console would typically log an array (which)
isn't a table, but could consist of only numbers
like some tables


console.table() is really more pleasing to
the eyes for small arrays. Lol */
